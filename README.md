This mod allows you to dynamically scale boss HP and damage, as well as the strength of their minions and other related mobs.

Features:
- Adjust boss HP and damage with customizable multipliers.
- Includes scaling for boss-specific minions and mobs appearing during boss fights.
- Minions related to bosses are scaled at half the multiplier value for better balance.
- Perfect for making fights easier or significantly more challenging.

Configurations:
- Boss Damage Multiplier: Modify how much damage bosses deal. Range: 0.1x to 10x.
- Boss HP Multiplier: Adjust the maximum health of bosses and their minions. Range: 0.1x to 20x.

Additional Notes:
- Determination of boss minions and mobs used during boss fights is based on manually curated lists in the code.
- These lists may not be exhaustive. If you find any missing mobs or incorrect assignments, please let me know in the comments so I can improve the mod.

Use this mod to fine-tune your Terraria experience and create the perfect challenge for you and your friends!
